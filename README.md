This project is my thesis, which is the result of my studies at Skillbox Online University as a Java developer.

A working application can be tested at the link: https://bobkin-web-blog.herokuapp.com/posts/recent

You can test your work as a moderator by logging in with your username and password: 

    login: moderator@moderator.com
    password: moderator

To test the project as a regular user, you need to register and then go to the application using your username and password. To be able to recover a forgotten password, you must provide a valid email address during registration.

The project is hosted on the Heroku cloud PaaS platform. https://www.heroku.com
